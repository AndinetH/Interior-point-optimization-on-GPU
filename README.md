# Interior-point-optimization-on-GPU
Interior point optimization on GPU. a code I wrote in 2016 to solve an interior point (IP) optimization problem on GPU (Jetson tx1). The focus is more on translating an algorithm from literature into a code snippet that should solve the IP problem and run faster as compared to a Matlab version ( targeted for a regular laptop).   I have also included below a screenshot of the actual output. In the output reported below, the variables x[0] and x[1] represent the optimal dimensions of the major and minor axes of a circumscribing ellipse to a group of vehicles.
